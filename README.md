# wellknown-dweb-friends

The idea here is to list content hashes/[CIDs](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/)
of friends web sites, so all friends in the network would help out replicating each others sites.


## Format

`.well-known/dweb-friends.txt`

Version 1 is a simple list of CIDs delimited by a linebreak.
